from flask import Blueprint


class AbstractBlueprint(Blueprint):
    """The AbstractBlueprint is the base class for all child controllers that makes a Flask Blueprint.

    Create an instance of Blueprint prefixed with '/bp' as named bp.
    Parameters:
        name: represents the name of the blueprint, which Flask’s routing mechanism uses and identifies it in the project.
        __name__: The Blueprint’s import name, which Flask uses to locate the Blueprint’s resources.
        url_prefix: the path to prepend to all the Blueprint’s URLs.

    There are other optional arguments that you can provide to alter the Blueprint’s behavior:

    static_folder: the folder where the Blueprint’s static files can be found
    static_url_path: the URL to serve static files from
    template_folder: the folder containing the Blueprint’s templates
    url_prefix: the path to prepend to all the Blueprint’s URLs
    subdomain: the subdomain that this Blueprint’s routes will match on by default
    url_defaults: a dictionary of default values that this Blueprint’s views will receive
    root_path: the Blueprint’s root directory path, whose default value is obtained from the Blueprint’s import name

    Note that all paths, except root_path, are relative to the Blueprint’s directory.

    However, a Flask Blueprint is not actually an application. It needs to be registered in an application before you can run it.
    When you register a Flask Blueprint in an application, you’re actually extending the application with the contents of the Blueprint.
    This is the key concept behind any Flask Blueprint. They record operations to be executed later when you register them on an application.

    The Blueprint object 'bp' has methods and decorators that allow you to record operations to be executed when registering
    the Flask Blueprint in an application to extend it.

    Here are the Blueprint objects most used decorators that you may find useful:

    - '.route()' to associate a view function to a URL route
    - '.errorhandler()' to register an error handler function
    - '.before_request()' to execute an action before every request
    - '.after_request()' to execute an action after every request
    - '.app_template_filter()' to register a template filter at the application level

    When you register the Flask Blueprint in an application, you extend the application with its contents.
