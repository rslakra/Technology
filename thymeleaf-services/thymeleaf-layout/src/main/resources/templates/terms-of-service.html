					("Shoppers") to scan and purchase products in registered stores
					(“Merchants”). Shoppers and Merchants are sometimes collectively
					referred to herein as the “Members” and individually as a “Member.”</span>
            </div>
            <div>
                <span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>As the provider of the
					Amey Platform, Amey does not own, create, sell, resell,
					provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any products to
					Shoppers. Merchants alone are responsible for their own products
					and services (collectively, “Store Merchandise”). Merchants are
					also solely responsible for their own listings of their Store
					Merchandise within the Amey Platform (“Product Listing”)When
					Shoppers buy a product in a registered store, they are entering
					into a contract directly with the Merchant and not with Amey.
					Amey is not and does not become a party to or become a
					participant in any contractual relationship between Shoppers, nor
					is Amey a store Merchant. Amey is not acting as an agent in any
					capacity for any Shopper. </span>

				dollars (US$100). The limitations of damages set forth above are
				fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Amey and
				you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
				liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above
				limitation may not apply to you. If you reside outside of the U.S.,

        </div>
        <div>
            <span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>(a) Mediation</span> <br/> <span>If
				there is any dispute about or involving the Amey Platform or
				the Terms that cannot be resolved amicably, you agree that the
				dispute shall first be submitted to confidential mediation for a
				good faith resolution that shall take place in San Francisco,
				California. The parties shall mutually agree upon a meditation
				service. The mediation shall commence upon the parties’ provision of
				a joint written request for mediation to the mediation service. Such
				request shall include a sufficient description of the dispute and
				relief requested. Each party shall cooperate with the mediation
				service in all reasonable respects and participate in good faith
				wherever required.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
			<span>Mediation fees and expenses shall be borne equally by
				the parties. All communications, whether oral or written, are
				confidential and will be treated by the parties as compromise &
				settlement negotiations for the purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence
				408 as well as any applicable corresponding state rules.
				Notwithstanding the foregoing, evidence that is otherwise admissible
				or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or
				non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either
				party may seek equitable relief, such as an injunction, prior to or
				during the mediation in order to preserve the status quo and protect
				its interests during the process. If, after the earlier of: (i) 60
				days following the commencement of a mediation hereunder or (ii)
				completion of the initial mediation session, the parties have still
				not come to a resolution for any reason (including a failure to
				actually meditate), they shall seek to resolve the dispute by
				binding arbitration as more fully set forth below. Until such time,
				neither binding arbitration nor litigation may be pursued by the
				parties. </span>
        </div>
        <div>
            <span>(b) Arbitration</span> <br/> <span>If the dispute is
				not resolved in mediation as described above, then arbitration will
				be administered by the American Arbitration Association in
				accordance with its commercial arbitration rules. Judgment on the
				award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court
				having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall take place before
				a panel of one or three arbitrators sitting in San Francisco,
				California. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The
				arbitrators will be bound to adjudicate all disputes in accordance
				with the laws of the State of California. </span>
        </div>
        <div>
			<span>The decision of the arbitrators shall be in writing with
				written findings of fact and shall be final and binding on the
				Parties. The arbitrator shall be empowered to award money damages,
				but shall not be empowered to award consequential damages, indirect
				damages, incidental damages, special damages, exemplary damages,
				punitive damages, or specific performance. The prevailing party in
				any arbitration shall be entitled to recover its reasonable, outside
				attorneys’ fees, and related costs. This section provides the sole
				recourse for the settlement of any disputes arising out of, in
				connection with, or related to this Agreement, except that a Party
				may seek a preliminary injunction or other injunctive relief in any
				court of competent jurisdiction if in its reasonable judgment such
				action is necessary to avoid irreparable harm. </span>

        <div>
            <span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Changes</span><span>.
				Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 (“Modification of these
				Terms”), if Amey changes this Section 18 (“Dispute Resolution and
				Arbitration Agreement”) after the date you last accepted these Terms
				(or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject
				any such change by sending us written notice (including by email at
