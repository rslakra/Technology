                        <p>
                            A web application (or web app) is application software that is accessed using a web browser.
                            Web applications are delivered on the World Wide Web to users with an active network
                            connection.

                            In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load for the application was
                            shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally. In other words,
                            an application had its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface
                            and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer. An upgrade to the
                            server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the
                            client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and
                            decreasing productivity. In addition, both the client and server components of the
                            application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and operating
                            system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest
                            applications (Nowadays,[when?] native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or
                            all of the foregoing issues).[dubious – discuss]

                        <p>In tourism industries, social media is an effective channel to attract travellers and promote
                            tourism products and services by engaging with customers. The brand of tourist destinations
                            can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For
                            example, the "Snow at First Sight" campaign launched by the State of Colorado aimed to bring
                            brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media
                            platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the
                            participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a
                            result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth
                            about $2.9 million.
