class AbstractTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
    """An AbstractTestCase class, whose instances are single test cases.

    By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
    'runTest'.

    If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
    many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
    subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
    that the instance is to execute.

    Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
    and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
    implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.

    If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
    __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
    should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
    of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
    in order to be run.
